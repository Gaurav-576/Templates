## Introduction
This repository showcases a medium-scale folder structure for integrating **FastAPI** with **MongoDB**, aimed at providing a solid foundation for developing web applications. 

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints, making it easy to create robust and efficient applications. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, offers flexibility and scalability, making it an ideal choice for applications that require handling large volumes of data.

In this medium-scale setup, we focus on achieving a balance between simplicity and organization, enabling developers to maintain clear separation of concerns across various components. The structure supports scalability, making it easier to add new features and functionalities as your application grows.

This guide will provide you with an overview of the folder structure, installation steps, and usage instructions for getting your FastAPI and MongoDB application up and running quickly.

## Folder Structure
The medium-scale folder structure is organized as follows:

```
medium_scale_fastapi_mongodb/
│
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── your_model.py
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── your_routes.py
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── your_services.py
│   └── utils/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── your_utilities.py
│
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_your_feature.py
│
├── requirements.txt
├── .env
└── README.md
```

### Explanation of the Structure:
- `app/`: Contains the core application code.
  - `main.py`: The entry point for the FastAPI application.
  - `models/`: Directory for database models.
  - `routes/`: Directory for API route definitions.
  - `services/`: Contains business logic and service functions.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests for your application.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required packages for the project.

- `.env`: Environment variables for configuration (e.g., database URL).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository/medium_scale_fastapi_mongodb
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file.

## Usage
